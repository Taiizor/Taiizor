## Hello World! 👋

Hello! My name is Dennise! I am a high school student based in Singapore and I have a hobby of creating projects that could benefit or be useful in any scenario. But I am really bad at maintaining them because I always look forward to creating something new, so if you want to contribute to my projects then feel free to do so! I've self-taught myself how to program and it took me a month and a half with absolute focus to learn C# (and .NET). My dream is to be... well, I don't know yet.
